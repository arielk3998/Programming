## 12.2 Example Pay and Profit-Sharing Calculations

**Compensation Structure:**
- **Base Pay Formula:**  
  `Base Pay = Standard Rate × Hours Worked`
- **Adjustments:**  
  - Experience multiplier (e.g., +5% per year of relevant experience)
  - Education bonus (e.g., +10% for advanced degrees)
- **Profit Distribution:**  
  - Profits are allocated based on member contribution and tenure.

**Illustrative Table:**

| Member Name | Hours Worked | Experience (Years) | Education Bonus | Base Pay | Profit Share | Total Compensation |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|--------------------|
| Alex        | 40           | 3                  | Yes (+10%)      | $1,320   | $200         | $1,520             |
| Jamie       | 35           | 1                  | No              | $875     | $150         | $1,025             |

**Example Scenario:**  
A member with 3 years of experience and a relevant degree works 40 hours. Their pay is calculated as follows:  
- Standard Rate: $30/hr  
- Experience: 3 × 5% = 15%  
- Education: +10%  
- Adjusted Rate: $30 × 1.25 = $37.50/hr  
- Base Pay: $37.50 × 40 = $1,500

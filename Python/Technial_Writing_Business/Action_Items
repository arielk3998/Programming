## Example Scenario: Action Item Tracking

Progress is tracked in a shared project management tool, and updates are reviewed at each general meeting. This ensures accountability and timely completion of all launch tasks.

**Tips:**
- Review and update action items weekly.
- Assign clear owners and track progress using a shared tool (e.g., Trello, Asana).
**Note:** This action plan is maintained in accordance with industry-standard project management and documentation guidelines (e.g., IEEE, ISO, Microsoft, Google) and is subject to regular review and improvement by the membership.

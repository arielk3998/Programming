### Membership Criteria (Skills, Experience, Education)
Membership is open to individuals who demonstrate strong technical writing skills, a commitment to the co-op’s values, and a willingness to collaborate. While a college degree in a relevant field is valued, equivalent professional experience and a portfolio of work are equally recognized. We welcome diverse backgrounds, including those with expertise in technology, science, education, or related disciplines.

### Onboarding and Mentorship Processes

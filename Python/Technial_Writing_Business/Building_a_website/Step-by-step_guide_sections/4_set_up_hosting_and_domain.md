## 4.3 Configure SSL for Security

- **Enable SSL:** Secure your site with an SSL certificate for HTTPS connections.
- **Free SSL:** Many hosts offer free SSL via Let’s Encrypt; activate it through your hosting dashboard.
- **Test Security:** After setup, verify your site loads securely (look for the padlock icon in browsers).
- **Renewal:** Ensure SSL certificates are set to auto-renew to avoid lapses in security.

**Tip:** Set up domain privacy protection and enable two-factor authentication on your registrar and hosting accounts for added security.

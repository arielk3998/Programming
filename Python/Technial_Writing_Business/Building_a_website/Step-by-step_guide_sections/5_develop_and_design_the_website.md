## 5.1 Build Page Templates and Navigation

- **Consistent Layouts:** Design reusable templates for each page type (e.g., Home, About, Services) to ensure a uniform look and feel.
- **Navigation Menus:** Create intuitive, easy-to-find navigation menus. Use clear labels and logical groupings (e.g., "About," "Services," "Contact").
- **Mobile Navigation:** Implement responsive menus (e.g., hamburger menu) for mobile users.
- **Wireframes:** Consider sketching wireframes or using tools like Figma to plan layouts before development.

## 5.2 Apply Branding and Add Content

- **Brand Consistency:** Apply your co-opâ€™s colors, fonts, and logo across all pages. Follow your brand guidelines for spacing, imagery, and tone.
- **Content Formatting:** Use headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs for readability. Highlight calls to action (e.g., buttons, banners).
- **Media Optimization:** Compress images and videos for fast loading. Use modern formats (e.g., WebP for images) and provide descriptive alt text.
- **Content Management:** Use a CMS or static site generator to organize and update content efficiently.

## 5.3 Implement Accessibility Best Practices

- **Alt Text:** Add descriptive alt text to all images and graphics.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements (menus, forms, buttons) are accessible via keyboard.
- **Color Contrast:** Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify sufficient contrast between text and background.
- **ARIA Landmarks:** Use ARIA roles and landmarks to help screen readers navigate the site.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Test with tools such as WAVE, Axe, or Lighthouse to identify and fix accessibility issues.

**Tip:** Use a staging environment to preview and test changes before deploying to your live site. Solicit feedback from team members and users to catch issues early.

## 2.1 Create a Sitemap

A sitemap is a visual or written outline of your website’s main pages and their relationships. Steps:
- List all main pages (e.g., Home, About, Services, Members, Contact)
- Identify subpages or sections under each main page (e.g., FAQ under About)
- Visualize the hierarchy using a diagram or bulleted list

**Example Sitemap:**
```
- Home
- About
  - Our Story
  - Team
- Services
  - Technical Writing
  - Editing
- Members
- Blog
- Contact
```

## 2.2 Draft Content for Each Page

- Write clear, concise, and user-focused content for every page
- Use headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs for readability
- Include calls to action (e.g., “Contact Us,” “Join Now”)
- Ensure consistency in tone and terminology across all pages

**Example Page Outline:**
- **Home:** Welcome message, value proposition, key services, call to action
- **About:** Mission, history, team bios
- **Services:** Detailed descriptions, benefits, pricing (if applicable)
- **Members:** Member profiles, join instructions
- **Contact:** Contact form, email, phone, address

## 2.3 Gather Images, Logos, and Branding Assets

- Collect high-quality images and graphics that represent your co-op’s brand and values
- Ensure all assets align with your co-op’s brand guidelines (colors, fonts, logo usage)
- Optimize images for web use (fast loading, appropriate formats, descriptive alt text)
- Store assets in a shared, organized folder for easy access by the team

**Tip:** Use collaborative tools (e.g., Google Docs for content, Figma or Canva for design) to streamline review and feedback.

## 3.1 Select a Platform

Evaluate the following options based on your co-opâ€™s needs, technical expertise, and budget:
- **WordPress:** Highly customizable, large plugin ecosystem, suitable for most use cases.
- **Wix/Squarespace:** User-friendly, drag-and-drop builders, ideal for quick setup and minimal technical maintenance.
- **Custom HTML/CSS/JS:** Maximum flexibility and control, but requires web development skills.
- **Open-Source CMS (e.g., Joomla, Drupal):** Good for complex sites, community support, and extensibility.

**Considerations:**
- Cost (hosting, plugins, themes)
- Ease of use and maintenance
- Community support and documentation

## 3.2 Ensure Responsive Design and Accessibility

- Choose themes or templates that are mobile-friendly and adapt to different screen sizes.
- Confirm accessibility features such as:
  - ARIA labels for screen readers
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Sufficient color contrast
- Test demo sites or templates for accessibility compliance (use tools like WAVE or Axe).

## 3.3 Evaluate Integration and Scalability

- Check for integration with essential tools:
  - Email marketing (Mailchimp, Constant Contact)
  - Analytics (Google Analytics)
  - Social media feeds
- Assess scalability for future needs (e.g., adding a member portal, e-commerce, or blog).
- Ensure the platform allows for easy updates and feature additions.

| Platform      | Ease of Use | Customization | Cost    | Best For                |

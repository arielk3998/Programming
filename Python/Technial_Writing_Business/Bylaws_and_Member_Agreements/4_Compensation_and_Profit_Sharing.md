# 4. Compensation and Profit Sharing

## 4.1 Pay Structure and Calculation Methods
The co-op is committed to a transparent, equitable, and competitive pay structure. Compensation is determined by the following factors:

- **Base Rate:** All members receive a standard hourly or project-based rate, reviewed annually.
- **Experience Adjustment:** Additional compensation for members with advanced degrees, certifications, or specialized expertise.
- **Role and Contribution:** Adjustments for project leadership, mentorship, or significant contributions beyond standard duties.
- **Complexity Premium:** Higher rates for projects requiring advanced technical knowledge or rapid turnaround.

| Factor                | Description                                      | Example Adjustment      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Base Rate             | Standard hourly/project rate for all members      | $50/hour               |
| Experience            | Advanced degree or 5+ years relevant experience   | +10%                   |
| Leadership            | Project lead or mentor role                      | +5%                    |
| Complexity            | High-complexity or urgent project                 | +10%                   |

*All rates and adjustments are determined collectively and reviewed at least annually.*

## 4.2 Profit Distribution Formula and Reinvestment Policy
- **Profit Pool:** At the end of each fiscal year, net profits are allocated to a profit pool.
- **Distribution Formula:** Profits are distributed based on hours worked, project involvement, and additional contributions (e.g., committee work).
- **Reinvestment:** A portion of profits (e.g., 20%) is reinvested into the co-op for training, outreach, and infrastructure.

| Distribution Factor   | Weight (%)         |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Hours Worked         | 60                |
| Project Leadership   | 20                |
| Committee Work       | 10                |
| Equal Share          | 10                |

*Example: If a member worked 10% of total hours, led 1 project, and participated in a committee, their share is calculated accordingly.*

## 4.3 Transparency and Regular Review of Compensation Policies
- All pay rates, profit-sharing calculations, and financial records are accessible to members at any time.
- Compensation policies are reviewed annually in a general meeting, with input from all members.
- Adjustments are made by consensus or majority vote to ensure ongoing fairness and competitiveness.

## 4.4 Example Scenario: Annual Profit Sharing
> At the end of the fiscal year, the co-op calculates net profits. 20% is set aside for reinvestment. The remaining profit is distributed to members based on the agreed formula. Each member receives a detailed statement showing how their share was calculated, and all records are available for review.

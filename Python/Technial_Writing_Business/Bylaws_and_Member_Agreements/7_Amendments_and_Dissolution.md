# 7. Amendments and Dissolution

## 7.1 Process for Amending Bylaws and Agreements
- **Proposal Submission:** Any member may propose an amendment to the bylaws or membership agreements by submitting a written draft to the facilitation team.
- **Notice:** Proposed amendments are circulated to all members at least 14 days prior to the meeting where they will be considered.
- **Discussion:** Amendments are discussed at a general meeting, with opportunities for questions, clarifications, and revisions.
- **Approval:** Amendments require a supermajority vote (e.g., two-thirds of all active members) to be adopted.
- **Documentation:** All approved amendments are promptly incorporated into the official bylaws and communicated to all members.

## 7.2 Conditions and Procedures for Dissolving the Co-op
- **Initiation:** Dissolution may be proposed by a written motion signed by at least 25% of active members.
- **Notice and Deliberation:** All members are notified at least 30 days in advance of a special meeting to consider dissolution. The rationale, alternatives, and consequences are thoroughly discussed.
- **Approval:** Dissolution requires a supermajority vote (e.g., two-thirds of all active members).
- **Legal Compliance:** The co-op follows all applicable legal requirements for dissolution, including notification of stakeholders and regulatory bodies.

## 7.3 Distribution of Assets Upon Dissolution
- **Debt Settlement:** All outstanding debts and obligations are settled first.
- **Asset Distribution:** Remaining assets are distributed as follows:
  - First, to repay any member capital contributions
  - Second, any surplus is distributed equitably among current members, or donated to a mission-aligned non-profit as determined by the membership
- **Documentation:** A final report is prepared and shared with all members, detailing the dissolution process and asset distribution.

## 7.4 Example Scenario: Amending the Bylaws
> A member proposes an amendment to clarify the process for electing committee chairs. The draft is circulated two weeks before the next general meeting. At the meeting, members discuss and suggest minor revisions. The amendment is approved by a two-thirds vote and the updated bylaws are posted in the shared repository.

# 6. Conflict Resolution and Discipline

## 6.1 Procedures for Addressing Grievances and Disputes
The co-op is committed to resolving conflicts promptly, fairly, and respectfully. Any member may raise a grievance or dispute by submitting a written statement to the facilitation team or designated committee.

- **Initial Review:** The facilitation team acknowledges receipt and reviews the issue within five business days.
- **Confidentiality:** All matters are handled with discretion and respect for privacy.
- **Informal Resolution:** Whenever possible, parties are encouraged to resolve issues informally through direct communication, with support from a neutral facilitator if needed.

## 6.2 Steps for Mediation, Peer Review, and Appeals
If informal resolution is unsuccessful, the following structured process applies:

1. **Mediation:** A trained, neutral mediator is appointed to facilitate a constructive dialogue between parties.
2. **Peer Review:** If mediation does not resolve the issue, a peer review panel (3-5 members not directly involved) is convened to assess the situation and recommend a resolution.
3. **Appeals:** Any party may appeal the peer review outcome to the general membership, whose decision is final.

| Step         | Description                                      | Timeline                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Mediation    | Facilitated dialogue with neutral mediator       | Within 10 business days |
| Peer Review  | Panel review and recommendation                  | Within 15 business days |
| Appeal       | General membership vote on resolution            | Next scheduled meeting  |

## 6.3 Grounds and Process for Suspension or Removal of Members
- **Grounds:** Repeated violation of co-op values, code of conduct, or bylaws; gross misconduct; or actions that harm the co-op or its members.
- **Process:**
  - Written notice of concerns and opportunity to respond
  - Investigation by peer review panel
  - Recommendation for suspension or removal presented to general membership
  - Decision by supermajority vote (e.g., two-thirds)
- **Right to Appeal:** The affected member may appeal the decision following the process above.

## 6.4 Example Scenario: Conflict Resolution in Practice
> Two members disagree on project priorities. After an unsuccessful informal discussion, they request mediation. The mediator helps clarify concerns, but no agreement is reached. A peer review panel is convened, which recommends a compromise. One member appeals, and the general membership votes to uphold the panelâ€™s recommendation. All steps are documented, and both members are supported in moving forward.

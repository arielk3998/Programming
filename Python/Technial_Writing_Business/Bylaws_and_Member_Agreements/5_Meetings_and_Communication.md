# 5. Meetings and Communication

## 5.1 Frequency and Format of General Meetings
- **Regular Meetings:** General meetings are held monthly to review progress, make decisions, and address member concerns.
- **Special Meetings:** Additional meetings may be called as needed for urgent matters or strategic planning.
- **Format:** Meetings may be conducted in person, virtually, or in a hybrid format to accommodate all members. Agendas are distributed in advance, and meetings are facilitated to ensure inclusive participation.

## 5.2 Quorum and Voting Requirements
- **Quorum:** A quorum is defined as at least 60% of active members present (in person or virtually) for decisions to be valid.
- **Voting:** Decisions are made by consensus when possible. If consensus cannot be reached, a simple majority vote is used. For critical issues (e.g., bylaw amendments), a supermajority (e.g., two-thirds) is required.
- **Proxy Voting:** Members unable to attend may appoint a proxy or submit votes in writing, subject to co-op policy.

## 5.3 Communication Channels and Record-Keeping
- **Channels:** Official communication occurs via secure, accessible platforms (e.g., email, project management tools, and dedicated chat channels).
- **Documentation:** All meeting agendas, minutes, and decisions are documented and archived in a shared, searchable repository accessible to all members.
- **Transparency:** Key decisions and policy changes are communicated promptly to all members, with opportunities for feedback and clarification.

## 5.4 Example Scenario: Effective Communication
> Prior to the monthly general meeting, the facilitation team circulates the agenda and supporting documents. During the meeting, members participate via video conference, and all discussions are recorded in the minutes. After the meeting, the minutes and action items are posted in the shared repository, and members are invited to provide feedback or request clarifications.

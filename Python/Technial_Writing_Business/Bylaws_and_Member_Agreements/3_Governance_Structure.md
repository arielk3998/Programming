# 3. Governance Structure

This section outlines the governance framework, decision-making processes, and leadership roles of [Co-op Name], following industry-standard cooperative and documentation best practices.

---

## 3.1 Decision-Making Processes

The co-op operates on a democratic, one-member, one-vote principle. Major decisions are made using the following methods:

- **Consensus:** Preferred for most decisions, encouraging open discussion and collaborative problem-solving.
- **Majority Vote:** If consensus cannot be reached within a reasonable timeframe, a simple majority vote is used. For critical issues (e.g., bylaw amendments, dissolution), a supermajority (e.g., two-thirds) may be required.
- **Quorum:** A minimum percentage of members (e.g., 60%) must be present for decisions to be valid.

## 3.2 Roles of General Meetings, Committees, and Facilitation Teams

| Body/Role         | Purpose & Responsibilities                                                                 | Frequency/Term         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| General Meeting   | Highest decision-making body; reviews strategy, finances, and policies. All members participate. | Monthly or quarterly   |
| Committees        | Focused groups (e.g., Membership, Finance, Quality) handle specific functions and report to the general meeting. | Ongoing, open to all   |
| Facilitation Team | Elected group responsible for meeting facilitation, agenda setting, and ensuring follow-up on decisions. | Rotates every 6-12 months |

- All meetings are documented, and minutes are shared with all members.
- Committees are open to all members, encouraging broad participation and skill development.

## 3.3 Election and Rotation of Leadership Roles

- Leadership and facilitation roles are filled through open nominations and democratic elections.
- Terms are limited (e.g., 6-12 months) to promote shared responsibility and prevent concentration of power.
- Members may serve consecutive terms if re-elected by the membership.
- Vacancies are filled promptly through special elections.

## 3.4 Example Scenario: Decision-Making in Action

> The co-op is considering adopting a new project management tool. The facilitation team adds the topic to the general meeting agenda. Members discuss options, share experiences, and raise concerns. After thorough discussion, the group attempts to reach consensus. If consensus is not achieved, a majority vote is held. The decision, rationale, and next steps are documented and shared with all members.

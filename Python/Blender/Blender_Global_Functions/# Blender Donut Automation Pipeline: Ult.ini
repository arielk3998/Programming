# Blender Donut Automation Pipeline: Ultimate Checklist & Guide

---

## ‚úÖ 1. File Imports & Paths

- [x] `SCRIPT_DIR` is set and appended to `sys.path` before imports.
- [x] All import statements match the actual filenames in `/Blender Global Functions/`:
    - `Add_camera_function.py` (not `Add_camera_functoin.py`)
    - `Add_light_functoin.py` (note typo, but import matches file)
    - `Bake_physics_funtion.py` (same as above)
    - `Frosting_and_sprinkles` (no `.py` extension, but Python will import as a module if present)
- [x] All imported functions (`add_camera`, `animate_camera_fly_through`, etc.) are defined in their respective files.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Function Definitions

- [x] `add_donut`: Returns a donut object, robust and realistic.
- [x] `add_icing_and_sprinkles`: Returns icing and sprinkles, robust, with error handling.
- [x] `add_camera`: Returns a camera object, robust, with error handling.
- [x] `animate_camera_fly_through`: Present and callable.
- [x] `add_light`: Returns a light object, robust, with error handling.
- [x] `add_ground`: Returns a ground object, robust, with error handling.
- [x] `set_render_settings`: Sets all key render settings, robust, with error handling.
- [x] `bake_physics`: Bakes physics, robust, with error handling.
- [x] `render_animation`: Renders animation, robust, with error handling.
- [x] `clear_scene`: Clears scene, robust, with error handling.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Main Script Logic

- [x] Order of operations is correct:  
  clear scene ‚Üí ground ‚Üí donut ‚Üí icing/sprinkles ‚Üí camera ‚Üí camera animation ‚Üí light ‚Üí render settings ‚Üí bake physics ‚Üí render animation.
- [x] All function calls are wrapped in `try/except` for robust error reporting.
- [x] Output path is set and passed to render settings and animation.
- [x] Verbose print statements for user feedback at each step.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. Potential Issues & Fixes

- **Filename Typos:**  
  - `Add_light_functoin.py` and `Bake_physics_funtion.py` have typos.  
    _Recommendation: Rename to `Add_light_function.py` and `Bake_physics_function.py` for clarity and update imports accordingly._
- **Frosting_and_sprinkles:**  
  - No `.py` extension.  
    _Recommendation: Rename to `Frosting_and_sprinkles.py` for clarity and IDE support._
- **Output Path:**  
  - `/tmp/render_output` is used.  
    _Ensure Blender has write permissions to this directory._
- **Sprinkle Placement:**  
  - Sprinkles are placed randomly above the donut, not strictly on the icing mesh.  
    _For mathematically perfect placement, use a particle system._
- **Multiple Blender Sessions:**  
  - If you edit scripts while Blender is open, always reload scripts or restart Blender to ensure changes are picked up.
- **`__pycache__`:**  
  - If you encounter weird import errors, delete the `__pycache__` folder in `Blender Global Functions`.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Final Checklist

- [x] All function files exist and are in the correct folder.
- [x] All function names and imports match exactly.
- [x] No duplicate or misspelled files in the function directory.
- [x] All modules are imported before use.
- [x] All function calls are wrapped in `try/except` for error handling.
- [x] Output directory exists or is created by the script.
- [x] All objects are created and linked to the scene.
- [x] All Blender operations are context-safe (deselect/select as needed).
- [x] All print statements are informative.
- [x] No missing dependencies.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 6. Troubleshooting

- **ImportError:** Double-check filenames, imports, and `sys.path`.
- **AttributeError:** Make sure the function is defined and spelled correctly.
- **PermissionError:** Ensure Blender can write to your output directory.
- **No Output:** Check Blender‚Äôs console for errors, and ensure all scripts are saved and reloaded.

---

## üéâ 7. Ready-to-Run

Your pipeline is robust and should run smoothly as long as:

- All files are present and named as imported.
- You reload Blender scripts after edits.
- You have write permissions to the output directory.

**Tip:**  
Before renaming files or deleting caches, make a backup of your project directory.

Notes on how to imrove the code

1. Physics-Based Bouncing
Use Blender’s rigid body physics for natural bouncing instead of manual keyframes.
2. Better Materials
Use Principled BSDF for the donut and add a simple icing material.
Use a subtle roughness and subsurface scattering for realism.
3. Lighting
Use an HDRI environment texture for realistic lighting, or add area lights for soft shadows.
4. Subdivision & Shading
Add a subdivision surface modifier for smoothness.
Enable “Shade Smooth” on the donut.
5. Camera Depth of Field
Add slight depth of field for realism.
6. Resource Efficiency
Limit subdivision levels.
Use low-res HDRIs or simple area lights.
Keep texture sizes reasonable.

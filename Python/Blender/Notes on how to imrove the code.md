# Notes on How to Improve the Code

## 1. Documentation & Maintenance
- Add clear docstrings and comments to all functions.
- Maintain a changelog for future improvements.
- Regularly review and refactor code for clarity and efficiency.

## 2. Physics-Based Bouncing
- Use Blender’s rigid body physics for natural bouncing instead of manual keyframes.
- Fine-tune mass, friction, and restitution for realistic motion.
- Ensure all moving objects use rigid body physics.

## 3. Better Materials
- Use Principled BSDF for the donut and create a separate icing material.
- Adjust roughness and subsurface scattering for realism.
- Consider adding texture maps for color and bump.
- Add roughness and subsurface scattering tweaks.

## 4. Lighting
- Use an HDRI environment texture for realistic global illumination.
- Add area lights for soft shadows and highlight control.
- Adjust light color and intensity for mood.

## 5. Subdivision & Shading
- Add a subdivision surface modifier for smoothness.
- Enable “Shade Smooth” on the donut and other curved objects.
- Limit subdivision levels for performance.

## 6. Camera Depth of Field
- Add slight depth of field for realism.
- Set focus distance and aperture appropriately.
- Position camera for best composition.

## 7. Resource Efficiency
- Limit subdivision levels and texture sizes.
- Use low-res HDRIs or simple area lights for faster renders.
- Optimize scene objects and materials for performance.
- Remove unused objects and materials from the scene.
- Test render times and adjust settings for balance between quality and speed.

# Action Plan

1. **Documentation & Maintenance**
   - Add docstrings and comments to all functions.
   - Maintain a changelog for future improvements.
   - Regularly review and refactor code for clarity and efficiency.

2. **Refactor Physics**
   - Ensure all moving objects use rigid body physics.
   - Set appropriate mass, friction, and restitution values.

3. **Enhance Materials**
   - Update donut material to use Principled BSDF.
   - Create and assign a separate icing material.
   - Add roughness and subsurface scattering tweaks.
   - Consider using texture maps for color and bump.

4. **Improve Lighting**
   - Add an HDRI environment texture for global lighting.
   - Place area lights for soft, controlled shadows.
   - Adjust light settings for desired scene mood.

5. **Optimize Geometry**
   - Add subdivision surface modifiers where needed.
   - Enable smooth shading on all curved surfaces.
   - Test and limit subdivision levels for efficiency.

6. **Upgrade Camera Settings**
   - Set camera depth of field (focus distance and aperture).
   - Position camera for best composition.

7. **Optimize Resources**
   - Use efficient texture sizes and HDRI resolutions.
   - Remove unused objects and materials from the scene.
   - Test render times and adjust settings for balance between quality and speed.

Scene Generator Notes

1. Choose a GUI Framework
For a standalone app: Use PyQt5, Tkinter, or Kivy.
For a Blender add-on: Use Blender’s built-in bpy.types.Panel for custom UI inside Blender.
        A. How?

2. Design the GUI
Controls for adding objects (donut, ground, lights, camera, etc.)
Sliders/inputs for physics, materials, lighting, animation settings.
Buttons to generate or update the scene.
3. Connect GUI to Blender
Standalone app: Use bpy in background mode (blender --background --python your_script.py) or communicate via scripts.
Blender add-on: Directly call bpy functions from your panel’s button callbacks.
4. Script Scene Generation
Write Python functions to create and configure objects, materials, physics, and animation based on GUI input.
5. Render and Save
Add options to render images/animations and save .blend files.
Recommendation:
If you want the GUI inside Blender, start by making a Blender add-on with a custom panel.
If you want a separate app, use PyQt5 or Tkinter and have it generate Blender scripts or control Blender via command line.

Would you like to start with a Blender add-on panel or a standalone Python GUI?
